# Problemset 2: Mad Libs

Description: Mad Libs are short stories that have blanks called placeholders to be filled in. This app has three screens; a welcome screen explaining the app, a screen that prompts the user to fill in the placeholder and after filling in all the placeholders it goes to the third screem with the filled in story. The app supports rotation of the user interface.
